# Fraction Class

The Fraction class is a Python class that represents a fraction with a numerator and denominator. It provides methods for performing arithmetic operations, comparing fractions, and converting fractions to different types.

## Installation

To use the Fraction class, simply download or clone the project from the GitHub repository. The Fraction class is contained in the fraction.py file.

## Usage

- To use the Fraction class, simply import it into your Python script:

```python
from fraction import Fraction
```

- Then you can create new Fraction objects by calling the constructor:

```python
f1 = Fraction(1, 2)
f2 = Fraction(3, 4)
```

- You can perform arithmetic operations on fractions using the standard operators:

```python
f3 = f1 + f2
f4 = f1 - f2
f5 = f1 * f2
f6 = f1 / f2
f7 = f1 // f2
```

- You can compare fractions using the comparison operators:

```python
f8 = f1 > f2
f9 = f1 >= f2
f10 = f1 == f2
f11 = f1 != f2
```

- You can convert fractions to different types using the type conversion methods:

```python
f12 = abs(f1)
f13 = int(f1)
f14 = float(f1)
f15 = round(f1, 2)
f16 = trunc(f1)
f17 = ceil(f1)
f18 = floor(f1)
```
